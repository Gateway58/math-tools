# math-tools
WARNING!: These "Tools" aren't even close to finished, don't rely on the anwsers or numbers they give you, this is only some hour work I have done in order to gain
more knowlege in math and programming, I will improve this every time I see a similar problem and they give the wrong anwser eventually. (Warning!: there is no guarantee that I will improve this every time I see a similar problem and they give the wrong anwser eventually) 
This repository contains all different math tools that can come in handy in personal use or in specific 
contests like naboj. 
This will be one of the only ones that will get consistent updates, because its not hard to edit, improve such or even add new ones. 
These files will NOT be in an executable format, because other OS can't run them (I'm 3/2 of my time on ubuntu so yeah) {I know there's wine but please hear the next argument}
and I want that you can edit these files yourself pretty easily, you just need vs code and a compiler that compiles cpp files 
(for windows search for mingw and for linux is sudo apt-get install gcc  and other commands, please be cearful with mingw downloads)

vs code: https://code.visualstudio.com/

[right now all files will be written in c++, this may change in the future
to java, c# or other but NOT to python, because python sux]
