# math-tools

This repository contains all different math tools that can come in handy in personal use or in specific 
contests like naboj. 
This will be one of the only ones that will get consistent updates, because its not hard to edit, improve such or even add new ones. 
These files will NOT be in an execudable format, because other OS can't run them (I'm 3/2 of my time on ubuntu so yeah) {i know theres wine but please hear the next argument}
and i want that you can edit these files yourself pretty easily, you just need vs code and a compiler that compiles cpp files 
(for windows search for mingw and for linux is sudo apt-get install gcc  and other commands) 

mingw: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/

vscode: https://code.visualstudio.com/

[right now all files will be written in c++, because its the one that I have to most experience with and it is preety fast, this may change in the future
to java, c# or other but NOT to python, because python sux]
