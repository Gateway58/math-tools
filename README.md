WARNING!: These "Tools" aren't accurate, don't rely on the anwsers or numbers they give you, this is only some hour work I have done in order to gain
more knowlege in math and programming, I will improve this every time I see a similar problem and they give the wrong anwser eventually. (Warning!: there is no guarantee that I will improve this every time I see a similar problem and they give the wrong anwser eventually) 
This repository contains all different math tools that can come in handy in personal use or in specific 
contests like naboj. 
These files are only to be edited within the code, more informations are in the comments of the file.
Every file is it own kind of "Calculator"
